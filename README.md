This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: how to correctly handle null values as function arguments. The initial code uses a naive approach, simply returning 0 when nulls are passed. However, this can be problematic and lead to unexpected results. The improved solution shows how to use error handling to more clearly signal incorrect input and avoid potential bugs.
